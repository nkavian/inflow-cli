# Changesets

This folder is managed by [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

When you make a user-visible change to any package under `packages/`, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Pick the affected packages, pick the bump type (`patch` / `minor` / `major`), and write a short, user-facing summary.
The CLI writes a `*.md` file in this folder; commit it alongside your code change.

The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) consumes these files on merge to `main` to open or update the
"chore(release): version packages" PR. When that PR is merged, Changesets publishes the bumped packages.

`@inflowpayai/inflow-core` is excluded via the `ignore` field in `config.json` because it is workspace-internal and not
published to npm.
